## Prerequisites

Make sure you have your development environment setup and configured.

 1. An Azure account with an active subscription - [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio)
 2. Use GitHub Codespaces - [Create a Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)
 3. Azure CLI - [Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    Run: curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

## Workshop Instructions
 
The workshop is divided into separate modules. Each module will guide you through building the solution code step-by-step. Ensure that you finish the modules in the right order as they have dependency on each other.

If you don't want to build the solution code from scratch, you can clone the source code repository final version by utilizing below command, and you can use the modules to deploy Azure resources using the provided Azure CLI commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop.git
```

If you are using GitHub Codespaces, just install Azure CLI and you are ready to go.
